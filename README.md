# Gladius Wiki

Welcome to the Gladius Network Wiki! Here you will find installation guides, pull request guidelines/conduct, and general project information.

## Project Overview

Gladiusâ€™ goal is to create a fully decentralized, peer to peer, serverless node network to connect bandwidth and storage pools to websites looking for DDoS protection and expedited content delivery. Anyone with a computer can download and run the Gladius edge node client in the background in order to rent out their unused bandwidth, compute, and storage space and earn Gladius Tokens (GLA). Large pools with hundreds, if not thousands, of nodes will then be able to handle a continuous stream of requests to validate website connections and block malicious activity. Gladius operates in similar ways to existing platforms, but we utilize compute assets that already exist instead of building new ones.
